So dance, 
This blog has been in my head for months, okay let's say years, but it became one of those things you are always starting but never do. But situations haven't changed yet and something needs to be said and someone needs to say something. So why not me and why not now. And yes there are dance blogs, in Kenya and beyond, but bear with me, this one is different.

Once again then.

**So dance**,

wikipedia definition is right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance">here</a>. In laymans terms, people move around to music or no music, it looks really weird some times, but most times it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vj54UEuxcQ">beautiful</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEIYHTlbeLA">magical</a> even. It has become a language that we use to say different things, like love, hate, anger, need, help, I am, we are, thank you, sorry, everything that can be put in words.It's a whole language on its own. And even more beautiful is how all cultures in Kenya, in Africa or the world have their own dances to keep their cultures alive. Alright so that covers the language and communication part. 

**So dance in Kenya**,

This is my part two. And the whole purpose of this blog. You ever visit bomas of Kenya when you were a kid or an adult, or watched the news when dignitaries at the airport when they come in and there are these guys dancing for them. Pretty dope. And they were in costume and all, pretty cool. Or were you in the drama festivals in high school, and did the traditional dances. Pretty amazing. Then we got a shot of the western world, and our dance changed. We adopted a bunch of what they did and for a while we even forgot our own and the guys at the bomas and the airport guys and primary and high school students were the ones preserved our own cultures. Again after a while, we started to remember ours and started incorporating our own into the modern. And then we started getting mad creative and coming up with our own. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqmIT3dVQyY">Odi</a>, Furi furi, sari sari (at this point I realized that these names though, hmmmm), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYQvE9dg9ck">bazokizo</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x60QeR1kjg">witinesi</a> (High key Favooouuurrritttee), zigwembe, sukuma, vimbada, thitima, shoulder back, then see kina madtraxx's song get down for some classics. We made one about bed bugs, I suspect this came from Juja called kunguni, coz you know Juja and bedbugs (no hate). We are a creative bunch we Kenyans. 

We have millions of youth in Kenya 35.7 (75.1%) million to be precise, and a good number of these guys love and live dance and art (couldn't find any statistics for this one, would be nice to have). But a quick or indepth tour of the internet for dancers in Kenya, I'm pretty millions is an accurate assumption. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dance+studios+in+kenya&oq=dance+studios+in+kenya&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.6525j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Dance_studios</a> are popping up in every county and small corners to allow young people express themselves through dance. Dance competitions in all TV stations are a thing now: Dance Afrique, Sakata Mashariki, KTN Family Dance Competition, Kenya Break-Dancing Battle.... an endless list. The very recent East Africa got talent show had thousands of dancers audition like these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3w9pgzLQuFM">guys</a> (high key favourite :-)).

This art is a big thing in Kenya right now and it should get some more attention than it is getting. I think I have accomplished my first mission up here, to just like warm up, put out some crucal stats, important links of some amazing performances everyone should see. But in all seriousness, Dance is a cool art, it's an amazing gift and talent, a superb profession and one heck of a release. **So What about it then?** 

We explore, find out how to make the industry better for the young ones who want to do it forever, expose some toxicities that exist in the industry, see how to bring back our culture in it, merge the new and the old to see how cool that marriage is and give some major credit where it is due. This is the **goal**, my goal. 

Yours Sincerely,

Me,

Human who loves information and tries to put it out there best she knows how.
